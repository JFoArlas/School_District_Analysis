# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of the analysis was to use python and Jupyter Notebook to provide the Chief Data Scientist for a city school district with a set of metrics. The data sets included information about students (e.g. grade, school, test scores), and information about the schools those students attend (e.g., type of school, budget, number of students). Once the initial analysis was complete, the school board found that one of the files used to perform this analysis showed evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appeared to have been altered. This required further analysis to exclude the affected scores from the original metrics. This alteration resulted in some changes to the final metrics.

## Results
Replacing the ninth-grade scores affected the following metrics:

- **District Summary**

- **School Summary**

  - After: 
  

- **Thomas High Schoolâ€™s performance relative to the other schools**
  - 


- **Math and reading scores by grade**
  - Before:

## Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
